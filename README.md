## Running these examples

All examples are meant to be run on the command line with Node.JS

There are four sections of examples (a, b, c, d), each with their own modules.

The entry points are the lettered files (a.js, b.js, c.js, d.js)

Furthermore, d.js can be run with either old or new implementation (as per the blog entry) by
editing d-config.js
